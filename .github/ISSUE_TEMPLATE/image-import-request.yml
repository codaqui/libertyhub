        ## Automated Process
        
        After submitting this request:
        1. Our system will verify if the image already exists in GitHub Packages
        2. If not, it will pull the image from Docker Hub
        3. The image will be published to GitHub Packages with the naming pattern `dockerhub-<image>:<version>`
        4. All steps will be logged in this issue for audit purposes
